        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <h3>Sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>0.66 Cup Sweetened Condensed Milk : </strong></li>
            <li><strong>0.5 Cup Evaporated Milk: </strong></li>
            <li><strong>0.33 Cup half and half: </strong>      
        </ul>

        <h3>Pancakes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 (15.25 oz) box French Vanilla Cake Mix:</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1.25 Cups Almond Milk: </strong></li>
            <li><strong>3 Large eggs, Lightly Beaten: </strong></li>
            <li><strong>4 Tablespoons Vegetable Oil, Divided: </strong></li>
            <li><strong>0.5 Cup Whipped Cream, or as needed (optional): </strong></li>
            <li><strong>0.25 Teaspoon Ground Cinnamon, or as needed (optional): </strong></li>   
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and half and half in a small saucepan and set over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. This is a sauce, not a syrup, so consistency will be on the thinner side.</li>
            <li>Add cake mix, almond milk, eggs, and 3 tablespoons vegetable oil to a large bowl, and beat vigorously by hand for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat, and lightly coat with remaining vegetable oil. Add 1/4 cup of the batter for each pancake. Cook until edges begin to puff up, small bubbles appear, pop, and leave small holes, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 2 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Serve pancakes warm with a drizzle of the tres leches sauce, a dollop of whipped cream, and sprinkle of cinnamon.</li>
