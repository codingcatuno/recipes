        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eggs: </strong>This waffle recipe starts with two whole eggs, whisked until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour: </strong>All-purpose flour adds gluten, which gives the waffles structure. You can also use whole wheat flour.
</li>
            <li><strong>Milk: </strong>Whole milk lends richness and moisture. Plus, it helps create the ideal batter consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil: </strong>A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, ensures the waffles are nice and moist.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar: </strong>A tablespoon of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking powder: </strong>Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it contributes to the waffles' light and fluffy texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt: </strong>A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors. Don't skip this step!</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla: </strong>A dash of vanilla adds complexity and enhances the overfall flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooking spray: </strong>You'll need to spray the iron with nonstick cooking spray before you start making the waffles.</li>
        </ul>
