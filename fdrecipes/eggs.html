        <p>Use your air fryer to make scrambled eggs if you don't have a stovetop and are craving this all American classic for breakfast time.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 Tablespoon Butter: </strong></li>
            <li><strong>4 Large Eggs</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Salt and Freshly Ground Black Pepper to Taste</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the air fryer to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place silicone liner into the air fryer basket and set butter on top.</li>
            <li>Allow butter to melt, 1 to 2 minutes. Increase heat to 310 degrees F (154 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine eggs and salt in a bowl and whisk until well combined. Pour egg mixture into silicone liner.</li>
            <li>Cook eggs for 2 minutes. Stir the eggs with a spatula and continue cooking until eggs are set to your liking, 4 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with pepper before serving.</li>
