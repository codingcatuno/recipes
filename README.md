We will be adding a sort of reflection at the end :)
And no I didnt mess the original Repos up ;o

Final Reflection, I had learned a more and got better use to vim overall. This project took quite a while but I feel like I learned to better use online resources like pictures and info from the web to formulate into my own code. I wont lie I am not 100% proud of my work because it doesnt look applessing to the eyes. I am trying to get a better mindset about my work generally though but I did improve my vim ability.
